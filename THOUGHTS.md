Thoughts on Muse Distill:
- Collect and extract audio samples easily from sources
- Experiment in soundboard (launchpad) like fashion
- Easy tools to input chords, set chord progressions
- Assists in finding relevant harmonies (cp detection?)
- Should be able to save locally, save to cloud, sync between clients
